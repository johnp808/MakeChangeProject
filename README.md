# Make Change

### Overview

For this project I created a simple calculator.
It takes the price of an item and the amount paid for that item
and gives you the exact change in dollars and cents.
if it is less than the amount due, an error message is displayed.
if it is the exact amount a message is displayed acknowledging that.


### How to use

* when prompted to enter the price you may enter a positive whole or decimal number
ex: 12 or 12.00
* when prompted, enter the amount you paid in total for the item with a whole or decimal number
ex: 30 or 30.00

The program will calculate the price in the exact amount using biggest bills and coins first.
ex: 1 ten dollar bill, 1 five dollar bill, 3 one dollar bill.

### Technologies

* Conditionals.
* Modulus Operator.
* Math.round();

### Lessons Learned

* Stay organized.
* use sysout to help troubleshoot wherever your mistakes are.
* Don't overcomplicate things, read the code written and understand the logic before moving on.
